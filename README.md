# Online Friends
This mod works on the popular minecraft server [Hypixel](https://hypixel.net/) to add the command `/of` to list a player's currently logged on friends and their statuses. (This command is automatically run when the player joins a server.) In order to work, this mod requires [CoolSpyLib](https://github.com/CoolSpy3/CoolSpyLibMC) and [HypixelAPI](https://github.com/CoolSpy3/HypixelAPI).
